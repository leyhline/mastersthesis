In programming, dependent types are the next step in the unification of language constructs. Not only values and functions but also types are first class constructs. This goes along with a number of practical advantages: Types may now depend on values, allowing a more precise typing, consequently better correctness guarantees and more expressive power when describing programs. Nevertheless, such power comes at a cost: As the difference between proof and program grows hazy, typechecking and program interpretation will face similar problems. The former becomes more costly and might be subject to the halting problem.

Over the years, different approaches and variations of dependent type systems surfaced. This work is bases on a subset of ``Label Dependent Session Types'' by \cite{thiemann2019}.
