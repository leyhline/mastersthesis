\chapter*{Abstract}

Dependent typing is a double-edged sword: One the one hand, it allows for more precise types, hence more guarantees of the program's correctness at compile time while also giving more hints about the program's structure and properties when reading the code. On the other hand, the programmer needs to provide these types in the first place, thus more work is required, especially in volatile code bases. A combination of label-dependent types with gradual typing---allowing dynamic typing in an otherwise statically typed language---is proposed by \cite{fu2021}. The present work builds upon this proposal to provide an implementation of \emph{Cast Calculus Label Dependent Session Types} (CCLDLC) in the Haskell programming language. The \emph{Cast Calculus} introduces an explicit dynamic type ``$\ast$'' as well as an explicit type cast notation ``$x : A \Rightarrow B$''. By applying rules for casts between arbitrary types and the dynamic type. This lays the foundation for gradual typing.
